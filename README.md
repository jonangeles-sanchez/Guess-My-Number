# Guess-My-Number 😎

📣Guess-My-Number Application is developed to create a user interface experience that allows the user to interact with the application and logically think with the help of the application.📣

🛠This application contains the use of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and a few other extensions.🛠

🔥The goal for this project is to learn how to develop an app that anyone can interact with and have fun with basic function and user interface.🔥

🧾A reflection of what I learned can be found below this entire description.📖

## 🔥Functionality:
### * User is presented with the interface developed using JS and other tools. 🛠
### * With the interface presented, readibility is made easy for the user to understand how it works _(May add instructions in future)_ 🛠
### * A box is designated to prompt a user input to begin guessing and take part of this game 🛠

### * User is presented with the interface developed using JS and other tools. 🛠
### * When a user enters a number, the game will log whether the number was too high or too low from the number they are trying to guess 🛠
### * On the top right corner, it is displayed the parameters that the number selected is being guessed. *(May add changeable parameters in the future)* 🛠

### * Each attempt a user makes, their score is decremented by one. 🛠
### * Score is kept track of from the beginning of the game. 🛠

### * When a succesful attempt is made, the game will prompt that the user has guessed the game and celebrate with a green theme to indicate that the user has successfully guessed the number! 🛠 😁

# What this project taught me 🛠
### 🧾This project allowed me to visualize how an application can become so interactive with a user. Besides the visualization. I learned what the DOM is, and how to manipulate it through code. Events was also introduced to me and how to respond to events,such as clicks, using code. I learned how to tie together basic HTML/CSS and JS to create an application that would be enjoyable for users by using logic, implementation, and manipulation of various works.📖
