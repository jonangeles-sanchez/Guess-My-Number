# Guess-My-Number 😎

📣Guess-My-Number Application is developed to create a user interface experience that allows the user to interact with the application and logically think with the help of the application.📣

🛠This application contains the use of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and a few other extensions.🛠

🔥The goal for this project is to learn how to develop an app that anyone can interact with and have fun with basic function and user interface.🔥

## 🔥Functionality:
### * User is presented with the interface developed using JS and other tools. 🛠
### * With the interface presented, readibility is made easy for the user to understand how it works **(May add instructions in future)**
### * A box is designated to prompt a user input to begin guessing and take part of this game
